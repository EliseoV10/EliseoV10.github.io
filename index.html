      <p>My name is Eliseo Vigil and I am a current intern at Arts Street. I currently go to West Early College and will be entering my junior year of high school. My dream would be as a director; I love movies so making them would be amazing. My current hobbies include watching movies, going to baseball games, and photography. The last hobby I mentioned, photography, is my passion. </p>
